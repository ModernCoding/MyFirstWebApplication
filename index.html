			My name is Michel Boretti, I am 36 and I come from France. I am a developer.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			I studied Chemistry in France and Germany ; more details about my studies here.

		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			As I came back to France, I decided to switch to a career in IT. I had the opportunity to enter an IT company and to be trained in the Mainframe technologies (COBOL, JCL, DB2, CICS) mostly used in the bank, finance and insurance industry. I have had the opportunity to work in France, Portugal and Spain.

			After seven years working in Europe, I got the opportunity to come to Vietnam and to work with .NET technologies. I have been working during eight months in Saigon and am now living in Danang since seven months.
		</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			Recently, I have decided to switch to Ruby On Rails : technologies are always keeping changing and so should we do !
